      <description>Satebo&amp;rsquo;s Wordgame is a homebrew game for the Satellaview (the Super Famicom extension). It is an implementation of the Wordle game, developped by Josh Wardle, that became popular in 2021 before being bought by the New York Times.
The game is named after Satebo, one of the two Satellaview mascots. (Satebo: ) and Parabo: ) Why did you spell wordgame in one word? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, why is wargame spelled in one word?</description>

      <description>Prerequisite Have a SNES emulator.
1. Download the Satellaview BIOS The file can be downloaded on the BS-X Project Blog
BS-X BIOS (English) [No DRM] [2016 v1.3].sfc I recommend taking the ENGLISH + NO DRM version.
2. Place the BIOS in your emulator config (optional) Some emulators automatically look for the BIOS in a specific folder or with a specific file name. Either way, you should keep it in a known location, as you&amp;rsquo;ll need it.</description>

      <description>Traduction française du jeu Satellaview (SNES/Super Famicom) トレジャーコンフリクス (Treasure Conflix) sortie en 1996 par Squaresoft. Le jeu mélange des éléments de RPG avec des combats aériens en mode 7. Cependant, l&amp;rsquo;essentiel du jeu consiste à parler à des PNJ et à résoudre des énigmes pour trouver des trésors.
Conseils pour une première partie Utiliser L et R avec le D-pad pour tourner plus vite. On ne peut trouver un trésor qu&amp;rsquo;après avoir obtenu un indice ou une carte pour ce trésor.</description>

      <description>English translation for the Satellaview (SNES/Super Famicom) game トレジャーコンフリクス (Treasure Conflix) released in 1996 by Squaresoft. The game mixes RPG elements with some airship fights in mode 7. Most of the focus is on talking with NPCs and solving riddles trying to find the locations of treasures.
Tips for your first playthrough You can use L and R in conjunction with the D-pad to turn faster while in combat. You can only find a treasure after you&amp;rsquo;ve been given the clue or the map for that treasure.</description>

      <description>Waiwai Check 3/21 (わいわいチェック 3/21) is a Satellaview game.
The ROM was originally dumped through the effort of several people and published on the Satellablog.
As the game was packed together with another one, I took the liberty to extract the game and rebuild a working pack with the game alone.

Sometimes referred as Koi ha Balance - Battle of Lovers (は is ha when out of context but read as wa as a particle).
This is a party game for up to 4 players in which you play as one of four brothers who are competing in a challenge set up by their dying grand-father, head of the family business.</description>

      <guid>https://krokodyl.github.io/post/2023/07/dokapon-gaiden/</guid>
      <description>This is the English translation of the Super Famicom (SNES) videogame: ドカポン外伝 〜炎のオーディション～ Dokapon Gaiden 〜Honō no Audition〜
The 3rd game in the Dokapon series.

Game 4 players (Human or CPUs) take turns going around a board. The goal is to have the most gold at the end.You get gold from different sources: random events, fighting monsters, fighting other players (you take half of the gold of defeated opponents) or simply completing a lap around the board.</description>

      <description>English fan translation for the SNES game
Kessen! Dokapon Oukoku IV - Densetsu no Yuusha-tachi.
The Japanese title (決戦! ドカポン王国 (ランド) IV ~伝説の勇者たち~) roughly translates to &amp;ldquo;Decisive Battle! Dokapon Kingdoms IV: Legendary Heroes&amp;rdquo;.
This is the very first game in the Dokapon game series. The IV in the title refers to the possibility of supporting up to 4 players and was probably also mocking the numbering of JRPG that was getting out of hand.</description>
