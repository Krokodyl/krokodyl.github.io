      <description>Waiwai Check 3/21 (わいわいチェック 3/21) is a Satellaview game.
The ROM was originally dumped through the effort of several people and published on the Satellablog.
As the game was packed together with another one, I took the liberty to extract the game and rebuild a working pack with the game alone.

      <description>English translation for the 1996 Satellaview (an extension of the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo only released in Japan) game Koi wa Balance: Tatoeba K-kun no Tabou na Ichinichi Hen. The Japanese title (恋はバランス たとえばK君の多忙な一日編) roughly translates to &amp;ldquo;Love is balance - for example, K&amp;rsquo;s busy day&amp;rdquo;.
Sometimes referred as Koi ha Balance - Battle of Lovers (は is ha when out of context but read as wa as a particle).
This is a party game for up to 4 players in which you play as one of four brothers who are competing in a challenge set up by their dying grand-father, head of the family business.</description>
