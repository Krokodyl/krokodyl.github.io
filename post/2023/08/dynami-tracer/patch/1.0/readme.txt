This is the English translation for BS Dynami Tracer, first broadcasted
on January 27, 1996 and developed by Squaresoft for the Satellaview.

It applies to the following ROM :
File: BS Dynami Tracer (Japan).sfc
No-Intro: Super Nintendo Entertainment System (v. 20180813-062835)
File/ROM SHA-1: 2FF4BC75B88480A35F42DB0A2468EB3F6F8E53E5
File/ROM CRC32: 41DAE33C

------------------------------- THE GAME -------------------------------
It's a treasure hunt set in space. You play as one of 6 characters competing 
against each other in a race called Dynami Trace.
You have two goals: collect as many treasures as possible from different planets 
and get to the finish line first. 
From the start, you can move freely between planets and even go to the finish 
line whenever you want. The winner of the race is determined by the order of 
arrival and the total value of the treasures. It's worth noting that the first 
to cross the finish line gets 1000 pts, and you can get more than 5000 pts from 
treasures. As you explore a planet, the 5 other characters controlled by CPUs 
do the same. Therefore, it's impossible to get all treasures. On each planet, 
you talk to NPCs and help them in various ways that will grant you treasures. 
You can also sometimes interact with the other racers, if they are on the same 
planet (you can see their ship orbiting the planet where they are). Since you can 
pretty much go to the finish line at any time, the game can be completed in less 
than one hour.
